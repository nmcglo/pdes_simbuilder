# pdes_simbuilder
A python module/library for building and running CODES and ROSS simulations

Currently in super alpha, the API is unstable so be wary that thins could drastically change from any commit. Use at your own risk.

I'm relatively new to writing python packages and am just learning as I go - no more warnings!

## To Install
Clone or Git Submodule the repository into the working directory where you'll be writing and running your simulation scripts from.

## To Use
Import the package via `from pdes_simbuilder.codes_sim import *` or import selected classes if you want to be more precise.
